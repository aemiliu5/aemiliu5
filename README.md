### Hey there! I'm Aimilios, a passionate, detail-oriented game developer from Athens, Greece.

## About me
- 👨🏻‍💻 I'm currently working as a Junior Software Engineer at IPHIGAMES.
- 🎓 I've got a BSc (Hons) in Games Programming from SAE Athens / University of Middlesex.
- 🎮 Video games are my main line of work, but other areas I've worked on include web development, mobile applications, and non-game interactive media.
- 💻 My main toolset involves Unity/C#, but I like to dabble in other languages and given the time, I can adapt to any workflow.
- 🏫 I love participating in game jams, amassing nearly 15 participations combined in The Global Game Jam, Ludum Dare, The Extra Credits Jam, among others.
- 🖼️ I adore both the creative and technical process of creating video games, and believe in their importance as an art form.
